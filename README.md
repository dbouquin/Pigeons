Synopsis:

	Pigeons are not always the pests hated with passion in the metropolic city nor were they a tourist novelty for photos. In fact, they have been an instrument of war in recent times. Some of notable pigeons were actually highly decorated for their services and sacrifices during Word War I. For this project, we examined the abilities of how a tiny bird like pigeons could have such abilities to achieve these. 
	Luckily, there are some association such as "American Racing Pigeon Union" stil raising pigeons for racing. We also scraped data from wikipidia.com to compare the flying speed of pigeons with other fastest animals. 
	RandomForest Calssification analysis, correction analysis, k-Mode cluster analysis etc... are performed and all results are put together using "shiny App".
