Synopsis:

	Pigeons are not always the pests hated with passion in metropolitan cities, nor are they just a tourist novelty for photos. In fact, they have been an instrument of war in recent times. Some of notable pigeons were actually highly decorated for their services and sacrifices during Word War I. For this project, we examined the abilities of how a tiny bird like pigeons could have such abilities as these. 
	Luckily, there are some associations, such as "American Racing Pigeon Union" still raising pigeons for racing and collecting data we could use. We also scraped data from Wikipidia.com to compare the flying speed of pigeons with other fastest animals. 
	RandomForest Classification analysis, correlation analysis, k-Mode cluster analysis etc... are performed and all results are put together using a "Shiny App".
